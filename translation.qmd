# The Doric Temple

::: {.callout-note}
This is a working translation (and in part summary) of Max Raphael's 1930 book _Der Dorische Tempel_. The translation, commentary and new illustrations are made by Jules Schoonman as part of his PhD research on Max Raphael's writings on architecture.

The text contains three types of footnotes: by Max Raphael from the original edition, indicated by `^MR`, by the editors of the Suhrkamp Werkausgabe, indicated by `^WA`, and new ones by Jules Schoonman, marked by `^JS`. In the source code of this page, the numbering of the footnotes in the original edition is preserved.

Existing headings have been abbreviated and new ones have been added for clarity and ease of navigation. Some of the editorial changes in the Werkausgave have been reverted to stay true to the original structure of the publication.
Translator's notes have been added through either `<!-- HTML comments -->` in the source file or [bracketed]. [Transcribed German text waiting to be translated is colored purple.]{.german}

	Explain the decision to avoid the contrast between 'exterior' and 'interior'. The Doric temple is ambiguous precisely where in- and outside meet, in the peristyle. Raphael's distinction is better explained through positive and negative space: the mass of the building and the space(s) it creates.

## Foreword {.unnumbered}

The intellectual history of Christian Europe is to a large extent an exchange \[_Auseinandersetzung_\] with Jewish-Greek-Roman antiquity. Overlooking the influential representations (myths) that have been formed about 'the' essence of 'the' Greeks, a distinction can be made between those concerning content, form and method. It is obvious that the last one is the hardest to recognize since it most powerfully penetrates ungreek matter with greek spirit. It nevertheless represents the highest and most valuable examination of Greek spirit. In each epoch, the three either run parallel or in succession, whose order is being determined by a multitude of factors. Of the youngest myths, the last two lingered most strongly in the consciousness of the educated layman: the classicist (Winckelmann, Lessing, Goethe) and the romantic (Burckhardt, Nietzsche, Bachofen). The first was mainly formalistic; the second content-based. Both were closely related to the formation of civil society; it remains to be seen whether they supported its revolutionary or reactionary tendencies. If I am correct, a new myth is currently forming among the intellectual avant-garde (Le Corbusier, Strawinsky, Picasso, Valéry). Its cultural-historical form and purpose cannot yet be overseen. Without disregarding historical patterns and relations, it will significantly depend on which forces still come into play.

This work consciously aims to contribute to a new Greek renaissance. It deliberately selects the temple of Poseidon in Paestum as the object of study. On the one hand in opposition to the classicist myth, which could only appreciate the 'terrible style' of this completely foreign world with the help of art history (Goethe: Italian Journey, Naples, March 23), as well as to the romantic one, which overall neglected the visual arts compared to sociological and religious factors. Then, above all, in recognition of architecture as the universal art and of the temple's realism[^MR-1] in conscious contrast to all the idealistic phases of Greek history and our own past. Not only the simultaneous universal and realistic object of study, but especially the investigative method aims to direct the the new myth. It excludes any developmental history and is completely based on a science of art rooted in a theory of creation, whose first task is the empirical record of the work of art, and second to assign to, or, better, derive from the empirical evidence a clear and comprehensive world view.[^MR-2] Since a science of art is lacking, we have to develop its method through the examination of individual works of art.

I will first discuss the design of the building and the space (_Raumes_), and subsequently the idea, i.e. the world view, which is expressed by this design.

[^MR-1]: I use the words realism and idealism epistemologically. ^MR
[^MR-2]: Such a science of art is empirical insofar as it departs from the direct examination of works of art, and logical insofar as it presupposes a theory of artistic creation independent of the place and time of the origin of works of art. ^MR

After visiting Milan in 1926 Raphael returns to Italy in 1928 to visit Rome, Napels, Paestum (February 28) and Sicily (from March 10). Although his plan is to continue to Athens, he decides to return early due to exhaustion. During his 1928 trip he visited and measured 12 temples spread over four archaeological sites, indicated by the colored markers on the map.

### Building Volume

Each building volume (_Baukörper_) has three main characteristics: extension (_Ausdehnung_), matter (_Materie_) and energy (_Energie_). Extension it shares with any geometrical body. Its shape (_Figur_) is an encounter of spaces, which divides the total space into two groups, enclosed (and designed) space, and excluded (and undesigned) space. Matter it shares with all physical bodies. It doubles the aforementioned border (between in- and outside) through which inside and outside no longer need to have the same form.[^dcdc6c08] The third characteristic, energy, is closely related to the second and is the play of forces, loads and supports, shearing force, buttresses, etc. The building is therefore the materially and energetically realized composition of spaces, that designs the demarcated enclosed space and its relationship to the exterior. The definition of the border will further determine the connection or division between both spaces.

[^dcdc6c08]: The surface of geometric bodies is endlessly thin; physical bodies are composed of matter which has an inherent thickness or depth. This can be shaped differently on the outside and inside, like the two sides of a wall. This results in two rather than one borders. ^JS

This definition is too vague because extension, matter and energy are such general categories that no body, not even a sculptural one, could escape it. Only the study of the nature of its relations and their concretization provides the right nuances for understanding Doric buildings as an architectural rather than a plastic body, as often falsely assumed. For now the definition is sufficient however to familiarize ourselves with the character of these elements in the Doric temple.

#### Geometric Figure

##### Integrated Structure <!-- Title added -->

The Doric tempel is a integrated structure, i.e. the compositional fusion of two different shapes: a parallelepiped (of planes and right angles <!--Cuboid: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid-->) and a prism (of planes and non-right angles) are fused into a shape whose front exists of 5 sides, and the total volume of 2 layers.[^bdb3b345] The first is the foundation, quantitatively superior; the other is the crown, spiritual closure. The compositional integration towards figural unity is achieved by (1) the diagonals that extend over the corners of the steps into the depth of the peristyle (_Pteron_), and further into the columns of the Antenfront[^MR-3]; the (2) concave upward movement, which, beginning at the stepped corners, anticipates the pediment through the tapering and slanting of the columns and beams; and finally (3) by the ridge connecting both pediments, parallel to the central depth axis.<!--Numbering added-->

[^bdb3b345]: Misprint in both the original publication and WA: 7 instead of 2. ^JS
[^MR-3]: This compositional anticipation of the pediment is clearly visible at the Poseidontempel, while lacking in others. ^MR

The idea of a building volume composed of two opposites into a unity-one could also say: a disintegrated unity-only becomes clear through a comparison with the simple structure of the Egyptian pyramid and the composite structure of the Christian church. In the pyramid, four coherent and unarticulated planes lean toward each other over a square plan until they converge into four borders and a point, so that each of the slanting surfaces becomes an isosceles triangle. The geometric simplicity is even greater in for example the Colosseum, where the oval shape determines the articulation of the upper floors, while not being replaced by another figure. In contrast, the Romanesque church is assembled from multiple parallelepipeds stretching in all three directions, where the assembly of the geometry is determined by a transcendental principle and pure religious view: i.e. following the shape of the cross.

##### Proportion <!-- Title added -->

These opposite elements, as well as the integrated figure resulting from their fusion, were proportionally linked for the Greeks. First it should be emphasized that e.g. 12 temples[^MR-4] of Magna Graecia fall into two schools of shared proportions (@tbl-mr-4a). This corresponds to the limited themes of Greek tragedy or the few principles of Presocratic philosophy. My assumption for the group of larger temples is $200 * 80 * 30$ Greek foot [$59.2 * 23.68 * 8.88m$] for the depth and width of the Stylobat and the height of the columns. For the smaller temples, these measurements are $115 * 45 * 15$ [$40.25 * 15.75 * 5.25m$]. The Greek foot measures either $0.296m$ (for example at the Poseidontempel in Paestum) or $0.350m$ (for example at the Juno and Concordia tempel in Akragas). All deviations can be explained on the basis of the individuality of the artistic conception that was realized in the building.

Dimensions of the stylobate and column height of 12 temples in Magna Graecia, separated in two groups of larger and smaller temples. Parenthesized numbers could indicate alternative readings by Raphael himself or taken from surveys by others; of only one reading @Koldewey1899 is indicated as the source. ^JS <!-- Compare alternative readings with measurements in @Koldewey1899 -->

:::

[^MR-4]:
	These 12 temples were all visited and measured by myself, as far as the remains were accessible. All the other temples, especially the Greek ones, are known to me from photographs, surveys, reconstructions, etc. My measurements were only an aid to my understanding of the works of art, not an end in themselves. I therefore readily admit that more exact measurements are possible. However, as they would depend on conjectures considering the current corrupted state of the monuments, an exact restoration of the original measurements will hardly be possible. Naturally, I have compared my measurements with all existing ones. I have come to the conclusion that the simplified manner in which Koldewey and Puchstein proceeded does not at all justify the dogmatic slumber into which the following generation of archaeologists has fallen. I will cite individual examples in support of my assertion, but these could be multiplied many times over. ^MR

The order of the magnitudes of the dimensions is: depth, width, height. This means that the earthly dimension of occurrences and their equivalence (_die irdische Dimension der Geschehnisse und ihrer Ebenbürtigkeit_), that cannot be escaped even by the movement of the head, forms the axis for the relationship between the other two dimensions. Often the ratio between the depth and the width of the stylobate is close to the golden ratio, and the numbers relate to each other like the small part to the whole. Frequently the overall height [of the pediment] is the greater part of the subdivided smaller part.[^735d58da] The golden section, which plays an important role in the Doric Temple for both the straights <!--strecken--> and the angles in the approximations $2 : 3 \approx 3 : 5$ and $3 : 5 \approx 5 : 8$, has the following characteristics: it creates a relationship between unequal parts which simultaneously expresses their relationship to the whole structure, and it describes the possibilities for the equilibrium between predominantly static and predominantly dynamic divisions. It therefore is an immanent, comprehensive and design-determining proportion.

[^735d58da]:
	For the larger temples, Raphael gives $200$ by $80$ Greek foot for the stylobate dimensions. These numbers do not relate to each other directly as the golden ratio, i.e. the plan of the temple does not form a [golden rectangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle).

	If we divide the stylobate depth in $120$ and $80$, these numbers relate to each other as the whole ($200$) to the large part ($120$), approximating the golden ratio. The width of the stylobate thus forms the _small part_ of the two quantities.

	The width of the stylobate ($80$) can be subdivided in $50$ and $30$, which again relate to each other as the whole ($80$) to the large part ($50$). These quantities then determine of the height of the columns ($30$) and pediment ($50$).

	The front of the temple thus contains a rectangle proportional to the temple plan ($200:80 \approx 80:30$) while the golden ratio is most clearly expressed in the ratio between the width and the pediment height ($80:50$).

	In other words, while the depth dominates over the width, as the width dominates over the column height, the pediment forms a definite closure to the structure as a whole. ^JS

##### Finiteness <!-- Title added -->

This is why the Doric building is finite and conceived for a finite eye. The entire architectural organism is contained between the depth-movement of the sides and the width-movement of the fronts; between the ascending stairs and descending roof. The movement is closed within itself, not from the outside; it becomes a being. All it is can be seen, although not in its being but in its effect. The varying intercolumniation, the asymmetries between both fronts and sides, and within individual fronts and sides, are only visible with a measuring stick and not _instantly_ to the eyes. The entire artistic meaning depends on their indirect effect: the liveliness in the repetition of equal parts. The building in its finiteness is not just rational, but the irrational moment is organically encapsulated in its creation according to its substance (_genesis eis ousian_)[^01cd8d99].

[^01cd8d99]:

	_genesis eis ousian_ - Schöpfung gemaß der Substanz. ousia ist die erste der zehn aristotelischen Kategorien. Raphael hatte wahrscheinlich »Wesensschöpfung« übersetzt.

##### Constancy

The Doric Tempel is a constant building volume. It cannot be prolonged, widened or raised without reconsidering the inherent laws of all dimensions in their totality. Within this constancy, and closely connected to it, one can locate an objective and subjective reality. The first consists of the probable ever increasing differentiation of the intercolumniation of the front and sides. Even after switching to contraction this was not completely abandoned. Still at Segesta, the centre intercolumniation of the temple’s front is not of the same size as the normal intercolumniation of the sides.[^MR-5]

[^MR-5]:
	This assertion and the following ones counter the measurements of Koldewey. For Segesta the difference is multiple centimeters. [...]

	:::{.german}

	Am Poseidontempel gehen Ku.P von methodisch unhaltbaren Voraussetzungen aus, überdies liegen an den Fronten wie an den Seiten Rechenfehler für die 'Joch'maße vor, so daß man zu einer völligen Verkennung des Tatbestandes kam. Es ist–wie die weitere Entwicklung ergibt– eine frei-rhythmische Kontraktion vorhanden, im Gegensatz sowohl zu der bloß einfachen wie zu der doppelten, aber metrischen Kontraktion, also ein Typus der Ringhallengliederung, der bisher ubersehen worden ist.

	a\) <!-- Enumeration added --> Puchsteins Begründung für seine Annahme, daß an der Front eine einfache Kontraktion vorliege, bezieht sich zunächst auf die Gleichheit der Stylobatplinthen an der Front. Er schreibt (s. 25, linke Spalte):

	> An den Fronten messen die Plinthen gleichmaßig 2.23, wenn auch nicht vollig ohne Ungenauigkeiten, die im Osten geringer als im Westen auftreten; ausgenommen von der Regel sind jedoch die Plinthen in den Eckinterkolumnien, die die beträchtlich geringere Ausdehanng von 2.09 haben. Etwas größer als an den Fronten sind die 22 mittleren Plinthen der Längsseiten, mit ähnlichen Ungenauigkeiten 2.25m lang; hier haben nicht nur die Eckinterkolumnien, sondern auch je die zweiten Säulen kleinere Plinthen von 1.95—2.09m. Diese verschiedenen Plinthengrößen sind direkt von den verschiedenen Achsweiten diktiert, die, wenn man von den Ungenauigkeiten im Versetzen absieht, an den Fronten für die mittleren Joche durchschnittlich 4.475, an den Ecken 4.28m, an den Langseiten jedoch für die Normaljoche 4.50, in den Eckjochen 4.25 und in den darauffolgenden ca. 4.33m betragen. Es sind also die Normaljoche je an den Fronten und an den Langseiten unter sich gleich, die der Langseiten aber etwas größer als die der Fronten (4.475 : 4.50), ferner sind die Eckjoche sämtlich kleiner (4.26) als die normalen, und endlich halten sieh die zweiten Joche der Langseiten mit ca. 4.33 zwischen dem Normal- und dem Eckjoch. Zur Ermittlung des Normaljoches an den Fronten und an den Langseiten bietet die größere Anzahl, aus der man das arithmetische Mittel nehmen kann, den nötigen Anhalt. Der fehlt bei den Eckjochen; da aber die der Nordwestecke nur um 1cm differieren, so muß man sie doch wohl als unter sich gleich groß betrachten, wenn auch die Südwestjoche um 4, die der Ostfront um 5cm voneinander abweichen...

	Diese Stelle zeigt deutlich, wie künstlich das gleich große Maß der Frontplinthen (2.23m) erzwungen wurde: was sich nicht fügt, ist zunächst ungenau; dann wird das arithmetische Mittel genommen, mit dem man natürlich alle Unterschiede einebnen kann. Es wird zugestanden, daß der Anhalt zur Ermittlung eines gleichen Eckjoches felht, aber man zieht trotzdem das Eckjoch einer kontrahierten Front dazu heran, obwohl man zugeben muß, daß nur noch eine von den 7 übrigen Ecken mit dieser his auf 1cm zusammenstimmt. Soviel Behauptungen–soviel Einschrankungen, soviel Argumente–soviel Willkürlichkeiten. Aber damit nicht genug. Auf Tafel IV verzeichnet Koldewey folgende Einzelmaße für die Plinthen:

	Ostfront von Süden nach Norden: (S = Saule; I = Interkolumnium)

	S|I|S|I|S|I|S|I|S|I|S
	--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
	2.15|2.08|2.21|2.26|2.27|2.26|2.29|2.23|2.23|2.08|2.21

	Westfront von Süden nach Norden:

	S|I|S|I|S|I|S|I|S|I|S
	--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--
	2.18(?)|2.09|2.19|2.21|2.27|2.23|2.29|2.22(?)|2.18|2.08/09(?)|2.15

	Daraus ergibt sich, daß an der Ostfront das 'gleichmaßige' Maß von 2.23 nur zweimal vorkommt, an der Westfront überhaupt nicht; daß die Ungenauigkeiten im Osten zwischen -8 und +6 schwanken, im Westen zwischen -8 und +10cm.

	Der Zwang dieses falschen Normbegriffes war so groß, daß er zu unbewußten Rechenfehlern bei der Feststellnng der 'Joch'maße fuhrte; denn die auf Tafel IV angegebenen 'Joch'maße stimmen nicht mit denen uberein, die man aus den dort angegebenen Plinthenmaßen errechnen kann.

	Ostfront von Suden nach Norden:

	- Die angegebenen Jochmaße: 4.30, 4.47, 4.48, 4.48, 4.303
	- Die errechneten Jochmaße: 4.26, 4.50, 4.54, 4.49, 4.30.

	Westfront von Süden nach Norden:

	- Die angegebenen Jochmaße: 4.29 (?) (25), 4.45, 4.48, 4.48, 4.26
	- Die errechneten Jochmaße: 4.275, 4.44, 4.61, 4.455, 4.245(?).

	Mit anderen Worten: Das angebliche Normalmaß, das funfmal vorhanden sein soll, kommt nicht ein einziges Mal vor. Die angebliche Gleichheit der drei mittleren Joche und die einfache Kontraktion wandeln sich in eine Aufgipfelung der Maße nach der Mitte zu und in eine doppelte, aber ungleichmaßige, d. h. frei-rhythmische Kontraktion an der Ost- wie an der Westfront.

	b\) Nicht nur innerhaib jeder einzelnen Front, sondern auch in Vergleich beider spricht Puchstein von 'Ungenauigkeiten', die im Westen größer sein sollen als im Osten. Man kann feststellen, daß die absoluten Großen der 'Joche' im Osten und Westen nicht ein einziges Mal übereinstimmen, sobald man die unbewußten Rechenfehler beseitigt hat; ferner daß die Kontraktionsmaße an beiden Fronten differieren, denn sie betragen:

	- an der Ostfront: 0.25, 0.04, 0.05, 0.19
	- an der Westfront: 0.165, 0.17, 0.155, 0.21

	c\) Für die Seiten behauptet Puchstein in bezug auf die Plinthen, daß diese mit den vier Ansnahmen der Ecken und der zweiten Joche gleichmaßig 2.25 m messen mit ahnlichen 'Ungenauigkeiten' wie an der Front; in bezug auf die Joche schreibt er (S. 29, rechte Spalte):
	
	> An den Langseiten ergab eine ähnliche Berechnung (die halbe Differenz der Triglyphen- und Epistylbreite) aus dem Normaljoch zunächst dasselbe Eckjoch. Außerdem hat aber hier der Architekt danach gestrebt, den plötzlichen Übergang von den Normaljochen zu den kleineren an der Ecke abzuschwächen, die Differenz zwischen ihnen weniger fühlbar zu machen und deshalb auch die zweiten Joche etwas verengert. Es ist dies eine zweijochige Kontraktion, wie wir sie weiter ansgebildet an den sog. Concordiatempel in Akragas, an den Tempel von Segesta u. a. kennen lernen werden, aber sie ist hier mit anderen Mitteln ausgeführt als an den sizilischen Beispielen. Denn während dort die postulierte Kontraktion auf die beiden Eckjoche durch Verschiebung der zweiten Saule verteilt worden ist, ist hier die ganze Kontraktion nur durch das Eckjoch bewirkt, und die Verengung der zweiten Joche durch Auseinanderdehnen und Vergroßern der zwischen den dritten Saulen liegenden Joche herbeigefuhrt worden. Es ist klar, daß darin eine Unvollkommenheit, eine unfreiwillig hervorgebrachte Jochdifferenzierung liegt, die man in den vollkommeneren Plänen in den obengenannten Tempeln vermieden hat.

	Zur Widerlegung dieser Anschauung gebe ich die Maße Koldeweys von Tafel IV sowohl für die Plinthen wie für die Joche, dann die nach Koldeweys Plinthen maßen ohne 'unbewußte Rechenfehier' sich ergebenden Jochmaße. In Klammern füge ich die von mir aufgenommenen Maße bei. Ich beginne mit der Südfront und schreibe von Ost nach West:

Von den 27 --- 4 Plinthen zeigen auf der Südfront 3 das 'gleichmäßige Maß' 2.25cm, 8 weitere Abweichungen von +1 und —1 cm, mehr als die Hälfte stärkere Abweichungen, die zwischen +5 und -5 cm liegen; auf der Nordfront haben 7 das geforderte Maß, 2 zeigen die geringen Abweichnngen von +1 und -1 cm, mehr als die Hälfte stärkere zwischen -6 und +6cm.
	2. Der Versuch, die Kontraktion der zweiten Zahl als nur scheinbar und durch Erweiterung der dritten entstanden hinzustellen, läßt sich nicht halten, weil von den 4 dritten Jochen nur eines eine merkliche Erweiterung auf 2 1/2cm uber das Normaljoch aufweist, wahrend an dieser Stelle 13 1/2cm auszugleichen gewesen wären; weil die Joche jenseits des dritten noch breitere Maße zeigen und eine Aufgipfelung der Maße nach der Mitte hin stattfindet; weil ---falls die Koldeweyschen Jochmaße gelten wurden,---an der Südfront die Kontraktion der zweiten Joche doppelt so groß sein würde wie die der Eckjoche, was mit einer indirekten Entstehung der ersten und der alleinigen Funktion der letzten schlecht zusammenstimmen würde.
	3. Es herrscht keine völlige Symmetrie der Maße weder zwischen Nord- und Südseite, noch innerhalb jeder einzelnen Seite zwischen der Ost- und West hälfte. Der wesentliche Unterschied zwischen Süd- und Nordseite kann dahin formuliert werden, daß in dieser die Kontraktionsmaße sich verkleinern, wodurch die Symmetrie zurücktritt und die Reihentendenz stärker betont wird, während aud der Südseite beide Elemente gleichmäßig zur Geltung kommen --- ein Unterschied, der dem zwischen West- und Ostfront analog ist.

	Alle aufgezahlten Argumente beweisen, daß es methodisch unmöglich ist, von 'gleichmaßigen Maßen' und 'Ungenauigkeiten' zu sprechen, wenn man sich den Einblick in die Tatsachen nicht unmoglich machen will. Trotzdem kann man den 'Durchschnitt', die 'Norm' nicht ausschalten. Aber sie sind nicht konkrete Großen, sondern das zugrundeliegende Prinzip für die Bildung der Größen, ihr Halt und ihr Rückgrat, nicht ihre Wirklichkeit. Und ihre Verwirklichung beruht nicht auf technischer 'Ungenauigkeit', sondern auf dem Prinzip des freien Rhythmus, dessen bestimmtes Grundgesetz an jeder Stelle variiert wird zu dem Zweck, eine vielfache Lösung ein und derselben Aufgabe zu schaffen: Reihe nnd Symmetrie in Beziehung zu setzen und sich durchdringen zu lassen.

Probable misreadings have been made red, and miscalculations have been corrected. On the north and south sides Raphael also provides his own measurements of the bays.](images/paestum-measurements-1000px.jpg){#fig-measurements}

Both fronts at Paestum are differentiated: in the east, large corner contractions are followed by much smaller ones at the second intercolumnia ($0.25-0.04-0.05-0.19m$); in the western front, on the other hand, the contractions are about the same size ($0.165-0.17-0.155-0.21m$). Their purposefulness is proven by the fact that these differences are repeated on the inner fronts [of the cella]. This is obvious in the remains at Propylon, Gaggera [Selinunt, Sicily]. Subjective relativity is obtained from the point of view of the observer and limited to the contraction or stretching of the visibility of the individual columns or intercolumniation. Limitations are set by the height of the line of sight that fluctuates within the height of the capitals; by the line of approach, which coincides with either the centre axis of the front or the corner columns; by the symmetry of the fronts and the constancy of forms down to the last detail.

By changing the capitals every other column, the Christian architect relativizes the front through the diagonal view, and this again by the totally different choir view, thereby emphasising the relativism of the building by removing every chance of affirmation. The church is turned into a visible sign for something invisible. In contrast, the being of the Doric temple is sufficient in itself and for this complacency – the condition for possibility of beauty – the constancy of the whole and the parts is stressed. But this does not alter the fact that the tempel will be seen from all four sides and therefore demonstrate for each side a corresponding expression of the view, within the same visual language.

##### Structure

The Doric tempel is a structured (_gegliederter_) building, according to form and number.

###### Subdivisions

There are three main sections, which are then further subdivided: the stylobate, with the steps, the colonnade with the beams, and the pediment. The lower part normally has an odd number of steps, which almost never resemble a square or a cube. Each step is higher than an average male footstep, in other words not conceived for a light ascent.

The middle part is divided into the colonnade and the entablature. The colonnade consists of fullness and emptiness, of object and air, of light and shadow, of projection and recession, of columns and intercolumniation.

The column as a body<!-- volume? -->---in contradiction to its conception as a play of forces---is a material stone body equal to an immaterial aerial body. The stone body is determined by:

- The ratio of its diameter and height, in which the number $5$ is constant, but in which in the lower and middle diameters vary;
- The height-width ratio of column and echinus;
- The number of flutings, the ratio between their width and column circumference (often determined by square number) and their own depth;
- The tapering which fluctuates between $D/5$ and $D/10$ [$D$ = diameter].
- Whether or not entasis is used.

The duality of the articulation of column and intercolumniation is not simply juxtaposed by the Greeks. Body and air enclose one another, interpenetrate the individual column (as in the complete building, as we shall see).

This is obvious when considering the following: the perpendiculars reaching down from the abacus form a pillar made of air, while those reaching down from the upper diameter cut a cilinder in the stone column. Between those lines lie the perpendiculars of the bottom diameter, which only touch the stone column in one place, and the middle diameter, which runs half in stone and half in open air. This interweaving of stone and open air figure corresponds to that of column and intercolumniation, as the aerial border of the column is positioned in the intercolumniation while the border of the stone column is the border of the intercolumniation<!--Add a footnote with explanation or an illustration-->.

The aerial body of the column can be measured by the column height without abacus, and the width [diameter?] of the upper echinus; the stone body by the height of the shaft and the middle diameter. Looking at the relationship between the two, 12 tempels of Greater Greece fall under two proportions: $2:3$ and $3:4$. Under a common denominator the proportions differ only a single numerator: $8:12$ and $9:12$. A variation which frequently returns.

The entablature is split into two parts: the architrave and the frieze. The first puts together all previous parts in a single wall-like band. Although it is unarticulated, the eye knows of the structure, rhythm, which is dynamically and silently sunk down into this band and whose secret nature is only indicated at its borders: by the gutta on top and at the bottom by the change of light and shadow. The architrave lays, in order to be supported; a weight held in in the air, high activity demanding passivity. In contrast, the steps, having a similar wall-like character, lay in order to support; high passivity demanding activity. This is the principle of reversal in creation.

The next building part, the geison with its flats and hanging gutta is part of both entablature and pediment. Like in the column capital, the unified piece has a double function and the border is only drawn by discontinued profiles.

The pediment consists of three bordering profiled geisa and the recessed wall.

The elements of the Doric temple are not numerous but nevertheless very differentiated. One could say: all forms are a variation of a principle. This principle is the division of the wall. It’s spatial shifting and curling up. In this way the steps, architrave, metopes, abacus, pediment and wall itself are just local projections or recessions. The column is rolled up wall, structured according to an energetic viewpoint. The triglyphs are reduced columns, unrolled to the wall plane, the gutta are little columns and the echinus is an upside down contracted column. The proof of the correctness of this view is the fact that the column circumference at least equals and often exceeds the width of an intercolumniation plus column diameter.[^MR-6] Moreover the fact that the distance between the core building and the columns is gradually decreased [over time?] until it equals or falls below the column circumference.[^MR-7] And lastly, the immaterial modelling plane cutting through the entire front and lining up the columns ‘invisible-visible’.

[^MR-6]: [Table indicating that no intercolumniation nor bay exceeds the column circumference.] ^MR

[^MR-7]: In the later Juno, Poseidon and Concordia temples, the east and largest pteron [distance between columns and cella] is less than the middle column circumference. The same for Temple C – wrongly dated by Koldewey and Puchstein. In the case of the Basilica, Ceres, Tempels A and E, the pteron more or less equals the lower column circumference. Only the early Temples D, F and the Herculestempel have a pteron which is larger than the circumference. ^MR

This limitation of the diversity of forms allows for precision in proportions and a relationship between proportions and various building parts, which no other art achieved. Thus the developmental direction is to bring ever more parts to the $2:3$ proportion, which was originally an angle-proportion in the ground plan construction. The ratio of middle diameter to intercolumniation, from abacus to a section of the architrave between two abaci, between triglyph and metope, between the two directrices in the plan all gradually conform to this constraint.

###### Part & Whole

In the subdivision of the building certain numbers are preferred: 2 columns and 1 intercolumniation are followed by 2 metopes and 3 triglyphs; each triglyph has 2 whole and 2 half cuts and 3 elevations. Furthermore above 2 columns 5 slabs with drops [mutules]; above each intercolumniation 4 viae [spaces between mutules], so that the numbers do not only increase, but first preferring square numbers, then the numbers $2$, $3$, $5$, from which easily the proportion $2:3 = 3:5$ can be derived. This creates a relationship between the preferred proportion ($2:3$) and the number of building parts.

To these numbers belong by no means the bay, i.e. the bisection of two columns and the connection of their inner half across the intercolumniation, or in other words the direct connection of parts unrelated to the whole. This is an unhistoric projection (by an historicist era) of a concept of Roman or Christian architecture onto Greek architecture - with which it has nothing in common.[^MR-7a]

[^MR-7a]:
    ‘Bay’ and 'column + intercolumniation' both originate from the wall, but have developed differently out of it and have a different relationship to it. In the Christian church, the void grows out of an interruption of the otherwise intact wall and it remains subordinate to it as a tangible non-being. The pillar, in contrast, is a projecting part of the wall and superordinate to it. In the Doric temple, the void grows out of the subdivision and rotation of the wall. To the extent that column and intercolumniation become real (the void is the being of the non-being), they become independent and the original wall disappears into an imaginary modelling plane. The (Christian) bay grows out of a transcendent principle and the trinity of wall, pillar and void results in the brick (_aufgemauerte_) architecture.

    In brick architecture, the bay is characterised by a contrast between load-bearing and supported parts, between wall and pillar - a dualism completely at odds with Doric architecture. The load-bearing and supported forces are decomposable in principle. On the one hand, because of this, the pillar is just a bundle of directional forces (_Kraftstrahlen_), whose formal coherence is only external. On the other hand, the decomposition of the total force in partial forces determines the bay.

    The decomposition of the column goes against the Greek spirit, because its bodily form is the synthesis of opposites. The architect of the Doric temple admittedly works with multiple bearers, but the load is one and thereby chains together the separate bearers. The Greek has a unity of force and form, the Christian a dualism.

    In the bay of the Christian church a total different relationship exists between the dimensions, and a different relationship to the total space. Here, width dominates; there depth. The single bay [in the Christian Church] is inferior to the depth-movement of the space as a whole, despite having an elaborate and diverse formal language (_Formensprache_). Column and intercolumniation [in the Doric Temple] are not inferior to the total width of the front; their spatial function does not exceed their formal presence (_formales Sein_) –-- contrary to the discrepancy in the Christian church. In the church, the arcade supports are primarily lonely as individual; its procession, tied together by a transcendental force, is an arranged row, in which the dynamic principle of connecting one support to the next is infinite. The ancient row of columns, of which each member is social despite its individuality, is the juxtaposition of singularities in a primarily defined and finite cube. 

	There is no essential connection between the bay and the intercolumnium + column. This is confirmed by the front construction to be discussed later, which calculates with the distance between the outer column bases, not with the distance between the axes.
	
	^MR

After the unity, main parts, rhythm and law of the coherence of parts have been determined, the method still needs to be outlined according to which the parts and whole are related. Contrary to the dividing (deductive) method, in which the part is determined by and dependent on the whole, and contrary to the additive method, in which the whole is composed of parts, there is no _immediate_ connection. Rather, because both part and whole depend on the same principle and the same laws of proportion, they indirectly and voluntarily form a harmonious whole. Within this general method of concordance, which later no one understood and applied better than Leonardo da Vinci, there remains space for gradual variations, depending on whether the parts are fit within the whole without being dependent on it (Poseidontempel in Paestum); the parts relate to the whole while emphasising their juxtaposition (Concordiatempel); the parts are placed above the whole, without making the whole dependent on them (Parthenon). If one combines what has been said about the relationship between part and whole with was has been said about the relationship between principle and formal reality (that will still be elaborated), one could characterise this further with sentences from presocratic philosophy, which recur in different variations: _kai ek panton hen kai ex henos panta_ (Heraklit, Diels, Vorsokratiker 12 B 10).<!-- add footnote -->

#### Geometric construction

The Doric temple is a strictly implemented geometrical construction consisting of few interrelated figures which return in different configurations in all temples.[^MR-8] Because the construction of the plan also determined the spatial composition (_Raumgestaltung_), only the construction of the front will be elaborated in the following. Presupposing that the Greek architect has indicated the element of construction in one of the strictly geometrical figures (pediment and abacus) – in contrast to the parts which have been relieved from the strictly geometrical – one can determine the following for the Poseidontempel (@fig-geometric-construction):

[^MR-8]: [Referral to Anhang.] ^MR

![Figure 1 (redrawn/unfinished). Geometric construction of the front of the Poseidontemple. Other than indicated in the text, the lower characteristic triangle does not touch point H (but the outer column axis?). The upper characteristic triangle has been added to the drawing.](images/fig-1-front-poseidontemple-1000px.jpg){#fig-geometric-construction}

One takes (on the horizontal axis of a right-angled coordinate system) in symmetrical position the distance AB between the two outer lower edges of the two middle columns and constructs the so-called ‘golden section triangle’ ABC, meaning an isosceles triangle [two sides of equal length], whose base angles measure $75^\circ$ and its top angle $30^\circ$, its ratio is therefore $5:2$; close to the golden ratio<!--??-->. The top touches the middle axis around the upper border of the triglyph, the sides the lower corner of the abacus. The first step of the next construction gives us the three main points of the elevation. If one draws the perpendiculars of the triangle from the corners, the 7th perpendicular determines the column shaft, the 9th the abacus top, and the 14th the height of the architrave. The number of these perpendiculars determining the elevation has a ratio of $7:2$ [$14:7$] and $2:5$ [?], which determine the plan ratio of the core building and the stylobate. That such relations cannot be found in the early temples (like D and C in Selinunt) but are present in older ones (like Concordia in Akragas) proves that the development of the building proceeded in connection with, and was dependent on the plan, i.e. that the building was a adequate expression of the spatial composition.

The starting points of the determination of the irregular, free-rhythmic structuring of the plan have now been set. If one constructs on the middle axis of the elevation at the height of the shaft and triglyph border (point D and C) for each point an equilateral [sides of the same length] and a right-angled triangle (whose angles can be divided by $15^\circ$) one can determine the following base points on both sides of the central axis: the axis of the second intercolumniation (E), the outer border of the second column (F), the axis of the second column (G), the outer border of the corner column [H]. Presuming equal strength of the columns, one can now determine the base points on the stylobat.

As a consequence of being able to construct the middle axis of the middle columns, the abacus width can be calculated, while the top width of the shaft is still missing. If one connects the central axis of the elevation at the intersection of the abacus height (K) with the base points of the outer columns, a triangle is formed whose top angle is $105^\circ$ (dividable by $15^\circ$) and has a ratio of $7:5$ to the sum of the base angles ($75^\circ$); in other words relates to the proportion of the stereobates ($3:7$) and the core building ($2:7$). The sides of the ‘characterising triangle’ touch the inner corners of the upper shaft of the two middle columns and thereby determine the upper diameter; in other words its tapering.

For the structuring of the triglyphs, the right angle at L, at the intersection of the axes, can be divided in $15^\circ$. The first ray touches the outer point of the second triglyph. The second ray the axis of the second triglyph at its upper border and the third the outer corner of the upper diameter, i.e. the outer corner of the last triglyph.

In this way, all the points of the elevation have been found and the construction is complete – only the pediment is missing. Presumably this can be found by constructing an isosceles triangle over the total width of the stylobat, whose base angle amounts to $\frac{180-75^\circ}{2}$ so that the relationship between base and top angle is opposite to that of the ‘characterising triangle’. The perpendicular of the base angle of this ‘pediment triangle’ touches the upper fries so that now point A and B could also be found by a construction from the top of the middle axis.

Characteristic of this construction, opposed to the later ones composed with similar elements in other temples, is first the repetition of the parallel auxiliary lines and right-angled triangles at two different heights, due to which the depth distances LE and LG on the one side, and F and LH on the other are proportionally linked to the height distance CD.

Second, the fact that between the parallel construction of regular triangles (isosceles and right-angled) an irregular triangle simultaneously cuts the central axis not in the middle but in unequal parts ($1:3$ measured after the absolute size, $2:5$ when considering the number of perpendiculars), thereby illustrating the lively play of forces in the building, the inequality of loads and supports. This disharmonic, characteristic triangle pulls all the dramatic oppositions in its form together and refers them to the resolution in the pediment.

Third, in the overal view of the construction. The triangles reaching downwards from the three points in the middle axis dominate over the upward reaching triangles from the base point. This resonates with the serious, heavy and tragic overal character of the building, the place of the part in the whole! The construction is a schematic but rational image of the optical perception.

##### Arithmetic

Closely related to this geometric construction is the arithmetic relation, which has always been acknowledged but never depicted properly. Because science cannot get away with depicting the proportional relationships between individual parts, without graphically showing their relationship to the whole (three-dimensionally, to be precise) and the variability of the relationships. Two examples to demonstrate the limitations of Koldeweys scheme.<!--add illustration-->

The comparison shows that the asserted congruence of individual parts by Puchstein immediately gets another meaning when considering their relationship to the whole. At the Poseidontempel the proportion $2:3$ is member of the golden section ($2:3 = 3:5$) while at the Concordiatempel each number is squared to move from the proportion which determines the details to those which determine the stylobat [depth].

##### Synthesis

The elements of every geometric or architectural body are mathematically either plane and straight, or surface and curve. There is no doubt that the principle of planes and right angles is used, but that in the appearance regular surfaces, mostly cylinders at the column, appear. This distinction between principle (_Anfang, arché_) and form, appearance [Gestalt, Erscheinung] has two important consequences. The intercolumniations have the tendency to take on an opposite movement tot the column. The original immaterial plane is dissected into concave and convex oppositions, which do not loose connection with the unity of the plane. We _see_ here what Plato has formulated as the fundamental problem of the dialectal method: how the singular and the many connect in a given number of parts (_Gliedern_).

The second consequence is that the imaginary planes only meet _invisibly_ in the axes of the corner columns, while the eye perceives a curve. In this way the connection of geometrical elements is freed of the pressure of the sole geometrical sequence, in which the planes meet in straight lines and straight lines meet in a point, like in the Egyptian pyramid. The mathematical demand for a corner made place for a cylindrical body, and thereby freedom. The gap between _arché_ and Gestalt and the freedom of being correlate closely, and both in connection to each other characterise the Doric temple.

##### Concave & Convex

The recognition that the concave and convex has to be understood as the dissection of the principle of the plane in formal reality can also be explained from another viewpoint. In no other architecture there is such an independent distinction _between_ the space that is inside and outside. In Indian monolithic temples the border of the volume resulted in the annihilation of the interior, and the volume seemingly became the architecture in its entirety. In the Christian church, especially in the Gothic period, the border itself was close to being abolished, to demonstrate that, regardless how thin the shell is between inside and outside, it is principally infinite and between two essentially different spaces. At the Doric temple, the building, existing of colonnades, forms a kind of equilibrium between in- and outside. We will demonstrate how the air flows into the building in a certain rhythm, flows through it. And inversely, that the front is linked to the floor plan, and that the historical development moves towards transferring even more constructional elements of the plan to the elevation, in order to create a close connection. Nevertheless to the eye the connection to the inside is loose, because the planes of the sidewalls fall in the axes of the second column (at the Poseidontempel), and from the outside the inviting banner is missing on the temple's forehead. The message is the rejecting 'know thouselves' (_erkenne Dich selbst_) rather than ‘come to me, all, who are laborious and burdened’ which adorns the portal of every Christian church. In this way, the colonnade becomes independent of the inner decorated space and undecorated outside. It would be principally wrong to make this relative independence absolute when claiming that the Greeks were only concerned with the plastic formation of the peristyle –-- and only plastic, not spatially –-- and that no architectural imagination had operated there.[^MR-10]

[^MR-10]: [Long footnote about the difference between plastic and architectural bodies. In short: architecture is based on the expression of forces; sculpture on the human body.] ^MR

Similar to the way in which the platonic Eros as daemon is the formal middle between the sensory-infinite and unity of the idea, between mortal and immortal, taking part in both but still being a third and independent, in this way the Doric temple is first and foremost the synthesis between the unformed outer space and the geometrically abstract plane as the ideal unity and principle of any spatiality; it is therefore formed space and despite its relative independence different from any plastic sculpture.

<!-- p. 26 -->

In summary [...], the Doric temple is the synthesis between the natural space and geometrical plane, i.e. its _finiteness_ is the synthesis between the infinite depth variety of natural space and depth dimension $0$ of the abstract surface;

Its _reality_ is the synthesis between empirical reality of natural space and the abstract-rational reality of the plane: the reality of a concrete idea;

Its _structure_ a synthesis between lively accidental association of place and thing, and the abstract homogeneity of place and plane; i.e. it is a necessity.

In the singular, unity is expressed as synthesis of simplicity and diversity.

The _ousía ek geneseos_ as synthesis between static and dynamic, the complete synthesis of ordered and unordered, etc. In other words: we concluded: unity as principle, dualism, or better antagonism, as method and form itself as result. [...]

#### Interplay of forces

Energies<!--Forces--> in architecture are different from other arts. They have a primary, as it were activating (_verursachenden_) character. It is impossible to think of them as independent. Where they are completed, they appear in abstract and mechanical purity – contrary to sculpture, where they are completed when they have been freely formed out of human will and concretised in human-sensory gestures. Finally they intend a direct relationship with cosmic and metaphysical forces, without any other means of expression than mathematics and physics (to the extend that this is a theory of forces).

Important for architecture are the selection, ordening and articulation of individual forces and their combined forms. Out of pure empirical grounds, I distinguish between the following kind of energies: the spatial-functional, the material-static and psychological-expressive. The material-static include the rotating, centrifugal, centripetal, normal, trust, sloping (_Neigung_) and bending forces. The relation between forces are general-mechanically: action (_Angriff_), reaction (_Ruckwirkung_; impost, _Widerlager_ [?]) and balance; optically: visible and invisible; material: mass or ray [?] forces; aesthetically: touch, penetration, resolution (free or bound), smoothing, breaking up.

<!-- add headings -->

a) In the doric building, the spatial-functional energies are expressed in the relationship between front and side, between steps and pediment and in the front itself.

α) The frequent [?] change in the number of front and side columns would reveal the importance of their relationship for the spatial composition, even if it would not return in the regular width and depth proportion of the stereobat. The energies of front and side pull on [attract], or push off [reject]. Because this relationship changes with the changing standpoint of the viewer (due to for example the height of the viewpoint) it is hard to draw general conclusions without repressing the diversity of the appearance and its liveliness. Within these limitations, the following types can be discerned:

- The side escapes to the front, which escapes from the sides, etc, so that a quintessentially centrifugal type is created, which prevents any kind of fixed appearance (_Gestalthaftigkeit_) or dramatic tension. An example is the Paestum Basilika.
- Sides and front move toward each other. In this centripetal type, the corner column of the encounter obtains a special character; it functions as the abacus between column and entablature. It is simultaneously the most dramatic and form-fixed (_Gestalthaft_, inflexible) type. And these properties are even strengthened because of the secondary reversal of the energetic forces, which become primary at some viewpoints. The Poseidon temple can be named as example.
- There are many steps in between these two extreme types. At the Segesta temple, for example, the long side moves in relative fast pace to the narrower front, which itself protrudes. Here, rather than the meeting-column, the exit and final column is emphasised as bodily mass, so that the movement between fixed columns is slowed down and smoothed to a mild transition at the bend.

β) For the height, the spatial-functional energies are clearly distinguished in three layers, so that the modelling [shaping] is both discontinuous and continuous. Discontinuous in the case of the layer by layer retreating steps and the projecting horizontal geison, which due to its slant shades its ornamentation (_Trophengliederung_) and enhances the illusion of depth. It is continuous in the rejuvenation and slant of the columns, due to the relationship of the decreasing width and depth of the fluting. It is often both continuous and discontinuous, like in the fluting, triglyph, etc.

The first layer is the complete foundations between the tops of the stereobat and stylobate. It builds all the subsequent layers of the tempel away from the ground, covers all the underground forces, creates a plane as smooth as glass, which rests heavily on the one hand, and is willing to take on loads on the other. The relationship between these two functions is expressed by the design of the steps, by the total and individual relations between height, width and depth. Here also variations exist between the prevailing of one of the extremes, width or height and their dramatic penetration, so that the raising of the columns is already prepared due to the bumping force with which the height dimension threatens to shatter the horizontal mass of the closed stone foundation.
